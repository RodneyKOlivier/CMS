A sample Customer Contact/Contract management system for a cat breeding program

This project is being written for my wife who runs and manages a small cat breading program. I am attempting to provide her with a method to manage her contacts, contract and breeding animals as well as any payments that she receives from her clients that relate to a specific kitten or older cat.

This project is written in PHP with a MySql back end and utilizes HTML5, CSS 2-3, JavaScript with jQuery using the UI, Table and SuperFish jQuery plugins.

Although this project is in Alpha Development I have placed it in a subdomain of my own so that I can allow friends and colleagues to perform usability and quality analysis on the application.
The following modules are at between 90% about 100% complete.

    Contacts - manage contacts and mailing list criterion
    Kittens - manage kittens - add photos etc.
    Dams - Manage Breading females
    Sires - Manage Breading males
    Contact US - provides a form to allow users (testers) to contact us.
